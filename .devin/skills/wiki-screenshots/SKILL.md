# Wiki screenshots

Full runbook: `docs/wiki-screenshots.md` in this repo. Reusable scripts:

- `tools/wiki-shots/seed_demo.py` — idempotent demo-data seeder (household member, timed recipes, meal plan, grocery list, food event + timeline data, wine, pantry)
- `tools/wiki-shots/capture.mjs` — Playwright capture against the stack (edit the shot list for new pages)

Quickstart:

```bash
LENA_DB_PASSWORD=e2e-change-me docker compose -p lena2shots \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml --profile seed up -d --build
python tools/wiki-shots/seed_demo.py
node tools/wiki-shots/capture.mjs
```

Key rules (details in the runbook): always use the separate `-p lena2shots`
project (never the dev DB), `--profile seed` is required, `networkidle`
never settles (wait on rendered text instead), and inspect every PNG for
loading spinners before publishing to the `LENA2.wiki` repo (`images/` +
`![alt](images/x.png)`, push to `master`).
